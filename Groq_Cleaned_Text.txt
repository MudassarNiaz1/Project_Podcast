Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

Pakistan was one of the top 10 fastest growing developing countries between 1960 and 1990, recording an annual average growth rate of 6 percent. The structure of the economy was also transformed during this period, with the share of agriculture coming down from 50 percent to 20 percent.

seven years, it has lagged behind other South Asian countries. A combination of political instability and disruption of the democratic process, lack of continuity in policies and poor governance have contributed to this outcome. Pakistan has not utilized its geographic location to take advantage of intra-regional trade and investment.

Pakistan's future potential can only be realized if it is able to position itself to meet the future challenges of integration into the regional and global economy, reap demographic dividends from its youthful population, and move up the technology ladder.

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

In 1947, Pakistan had 30 million people with a per-capita income of US$100. Agriculture accounted for almost 50 percent of the economic output with hardly any manufacturing, as all industries were located in India.

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

Pakistan's economy faces significant challenges, including governance, political stability, economic assistance, terrorism, growth, and fiscal policies.

Pakistan's economy has made significant progress since it was unable to feed 30 million people and was dependent on PL-480 imports from the United States. Today, with a population of over 200 million, the per-capita income has risen 13 times, reaching $1,468 in 2016.

Pakistan is one of the world's major grain producers to feed its people. It is also one of the five major textile-producing countries globally. The country's economic structure has undergone significant transformations during this period.

The share of agriculture in the economy has decreased from 50% to 20%, while agricultural productivity has risen. Despite a seven-fold increase in population, the actual production has outpaced population growth.

Pakistan has become the third largest producer of milk in the world. The country's agricultural sector has undergone a significant shift, with livestock, dairy, mutton, beef, and poultry products accounting for 55% of the total output.

Pakistan's economy has undergone significant transformation since its inception. The services sector now dominates the national economy, accounting for 55% of GDP and employing a large portion of the population.

Pakistan's growth record has been impressive, with the economy growing at an average annual rate of slightly above 5% over the last six decades. In per-capita terms, the growth rate has been 2.5% annually.

Pakistan's sectoral GDP growth rates show that industry, including manufacturing, has been the most dynamic sector of the economy. In the regional context, Pakistan grew faster than South Asia by an average of 2% through most of the 1960s and 1970s, and at similar rates during the 1980s. However, since 1993, Pakistan's growth has been below the regional average.

Pakistan's growth rate in South Asia was a significant topic of discussion. According to the World Bank, in 1965, Pakistan exported more manufactured goods than Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Turkey combined. However, by the 1990s, Pakistan had become the slowest growing country in South Asia, a stark reversal of its previous role.

Despite this, the incidence of poverty has declined significantly, from 46% in the mid-1960s to 18% today. However, despite this progress, inter-personal, regional, and gender disparities appear to have intensified.

development indicators have not kept pace with the growth in per-capita incomes. What are the factors responsible for this reversal? The main explanatory factor for this reversal is the paradigm shift in the basic model of development brought about by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto soon after assuming power in 1971.

The experiment with socialism in Pakistan had a negative impact on industrial development, export expansion, and the quality of education. It gave an overarching role to the bureaucracy in economic decision-making, which suppressed the dynamism of the private sector.

Pakistan's economy faced significant challenges in the 1970s. Unreliable and expensive power, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of law and order discouraged investment. This reluctance to invest explains why the private sector was hesitant to make long-term commitments. The disintegration of East and West Pakistan's unified economy and the subsequent formation of Bangladesh as an independent country also caused economic tremors in this period.

The opportunity to undo most of the damage done by nationalization

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

The Zia-ul-Haq regime, which lasted from 1977 to 1988, failed to take proactive measures to reverse the state-owned dominated economy. Instead, it maintained the status quo. Although Bhutto's path was not followed, the process of nationalization was abandoned, but the preference for the public sector did not diminish.

The economic performance during this period was impressive, not due to any fundamental policy or institutional changes.

Here is the processed text:

Reforms in Pakistan's economy were aided by the output from large public sector investments made in the 1970s, particularly the Tarbela Dam, which increased irrigation water availability, hydel power capacity, and production of fertilizer, steel, and cement.

Macroeconomic imbalances in the 1980s, including large fiscal and current account deficits, had repercussions for the economy in the subsequent period.

The form of increased debt burden. Real defence spending increased on an average by 9% per annum during this period, while development spending rose to 3% per annum. Defence spending averaged 6.5% of the GDP in this decade and contributed to large fiscal deficits and a rapid build-up of public debt. The neglect of development spending was one of the contributory factors to slow growth in the 1990s.

Although the Nawaz Sharif regime introduced major economic liberalization reforms in 1991, both private investment and exports tended to stagnate or decline through the 1990s. Macroeconomic sustainability was a serious problem.

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

Pakistan's economy has been negatively affected by the level playing field being distorted by SROs. This has led to investors competing based on their ability to secure special deals rather than business fundamentals.

The frequent changes in government throughout the 1990s and political instability that followed had a devastating impact on the economy. The uncertainty and discontinuity of economic policies, patronage-based governance, and exogenous shocks all contributed to this chaos.

Pakistan's economy was derailed from its tracks. Investment ratio dived south and persistent fiscal and current account deficits led to accumulation of large unsustainable domestic and external debt throughout the decade. The ratio of debt servicing.

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

Pakistan's economy has faced significant challenges in recent years. International capital was hesitant as the risk profile had heightened significantly. This was largely due to the freezing of foreign currency accounts of residents and non-residents in the aftermath of the 1998 nuclear tests, which eroded investor and business confidence in the economy.

Pakistan's economy faced significant challenges in the late 1990s. Incidence of poverty doubled from 18 to 34 percent during this decade. The withdrawal of US aid after the end of the Afghan war and the imposition of sanctions by Western governments following the nuclear tests in 1998 further accentuated economic difficulties.

The military government that came to power in October 1999 had economic recovery as one of its professed objectives. Despite sanctions of all kinds, the new government aimed to revive the economy.

government assembled a team of technocrats as part of its Cabinet and embarked upon a series of structural reforms during 2000 and 2007. However, the events of 11 September 2001 significantly changed the geostrategic importance of Pakistan. The country's alliance with the US and NATO in the war against terrorism restored international financial aid and increased the volume of flows. 

It was during this period that

Pakistan successfully implemented a nine-month stand-by and three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2000–2004. The country also re-profiled its stock of official development assistance (ODA) and non-ODA bilateral debt with the Paris Club. The USA cancelled its bilateral debt of US$1 billion.

Investment picked up to 24 per cent of GDP, and foreign direct investment (FDI) touched US$5 billion in 2007. As a result, Pakistan's economy began to grow.

Pakistan's economy bounced back in the 1999-2008 period, with GDP growth averaging 6.3% per year. This was achieved through a combination of economic reforms, investment boosts, external assistance, and debt relief. At the same time, devolution to local governments and the empowerment of elected officials at the district level improved the delivery of basic public services.

Enrolment at primary level also recorded some improvement, along with children immunization, incidence of diarrhoea and infant mortality.

The reforms and governance improvements of the past seven years were not sustained, and some were reversed, halted or modified in the post-2008 period.

Pakistan's economy and regional challenges were welcome steps. However, the local governments were abolished and access to basic services and the quality of governance suffered.

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

The analysis shows that initially the shift in the economic paradigm under Bhutto initiated the drift, but subsequent inconsistency, discontinuity and lack of coherence in economic policies, political instability, weak domestic security and law and order, poor governance, unwillingness to take tough but unpopular decisions to set the course of the economy right, and impaired implementation hindered progress.

Pakistan's economy has been struggling due to the capacity of government agencies, leading to a secular decline in growth rates. The country underperformed compared to others with similar per-capita incomes in various social indicators, known as the 'social gap'. This gap was particularly large for women, creating a 'gender gap' that reinforced the social gap. As a result, the growth rate was stunted, making it difficult for Pakistan to make progress in a globalized economy.

without an educated and healthy workforce. Growth, Poverty and Inequality

How has growth affected incidence of poverty in Pakistan? The earliest published data on poverty incidence available pertains to 1963-1964 and it is difficult to estimate what proportion of the population was living below the poverty line at the time of independence.

The provinces constituting Pakistan were relatively backward compared to the provinces inherited by India.

Pakistan's formation led to a significant issue with refugees facing dire economic conditions in the early years. It is estimated that around 50 to 60% of the population was living below poverty in 1950. A more recent survey conducted in 2004-2005 showed that this proportion had halved to 24%, and further decreased to 18% by 2011-2012.

Poverty rates decreased from 40% in 1963-1964 to 17% in

Pakistan's economy has experienced fluctuations in the decades of the 1960s and 1990s, with a rising trend followed by a decline, and then another rise in the 2000s. Despite a decline in poverty levels, social indicators have not kept pace with income growth.

According to the Human Development Index (HDI), Pakistan ranked 147th out of 188 countries in 2017, with an HDI value of 0.55, just above the low HDI cut-off point. Almost half of the population is illiterate.

Pakistan's economy faces significant challenges, with only one-third of the female population being literate. Moreover, more than half of the population lacks access to decent health facilities, resulting in a high infant mortality rate of 80 per thousand. The health status of women and children is particularly low. Female labor force participation rates are the lowest among South Asian countries, indicating a significant gap in economic opportunities.

Pakistan's economy has achieved below average improvement in human development indicators. The long-term trends of economic growth, poverty, and inequality in Pakistan are highly ambiguous. Income inequality has declined and increased during periods of high growth, but consistently increases when growth rates are low.

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

In the early 1990s, the difference in poverty levels between urban and rural areas was 8 percentage points, which had widened to 13 percentage points by 2004-2005. Despite a remarkable reduction in poverty of almost 10 percentage points in a relatively short period of time, there has been an increase in income inequality as well as urban-rural disparities.

The main thrust of the reforms undertaken since 1991 has been to allow greater freedom to the private sector to own, produce, distribute, and trade goods and services while gradually withdrawing the public sector from this arena.

Government intervention in the economy was justified for social protection of the poor, provision of public goods, infrastructure, human development, and science and technology.

It is another issue that the political party in opposition always makes it difficult for the ruling party to implement reforms. Significant efforts were made in unilaterally liberalizing the trade regime.

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

Morals, and religious and cultural concerns, the statutory orders that exempted certain industries from import duties or provided selective concessions to privileged individual firms were phased out. Import duties on 4,000 items were reduced. Laws were promulgated to bring the trade regime in conformity with World Trade Organization regulations. These include anti-dumping and countervailing measures and protection of intellectual property.

Pakistani exports benefited from a stable exchange rate policy, which maintained predictability and competitiveness.

Fiscal policy reforms aimed to consolidate the economy by increasing tax revenues, reducing expenditures, cutting subsidies, and containing losses from public enterprises.

Pakistan's economy has relied heavily on the Value Added Tax (VAT) as its major source of revenue, simplifying tax administration and strengthening the Central Board of Revenue's capacity. Although some progress was made with these reforms, other elements such as the universal self-assessment scheme and tax machinery reorganization did not yield significant results. The reversal of tax reforms in 2008 and poor enforcement and compliance have kept the tax-GDP ratio stagnant.

Pakistan's economy has experienced a growth of 9% since 2009. One of the sources of fiscal problems was triggered by the losses and inefficiencies of public enterprises. To address this, the government pursued an aggressive privatization plan, focusing on selling assets to strategic investors.

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

The privatization process in Pakistan led to a large number of successful transactions. Between 2002 and 2007, the country yielded $3 billion from privatized banks. Despite their inefficiencies in delivering services, these banks made substantial contributions.

Pakistan's economy has seen significant improvement since privatization. State-owned enterprises have become profitable, unlike in the past when they were incurring losses due to non-performing loans. The pace of privatization has accelerated since 2014, with the previous government being reluctant to relinquish control over public enterprises.

The previous government's reluctance to privatize led to a slowdown in the process. In contrast, the current government has shown more willingness to let go of its control and allow private companies to take over. This change in approach has led to a significant improvement in the country's economy.

Pakistan's economy experienced significant positive results due to the efforts of the government. Oil and gas exploration activity increased, and private sector companies made constant discoveries and productions from new gas fields, adding new capacity to meet the growing energy needs of the country.

natural gas to compressed natural gas at subsidized rates and new connections to households on political grounds did create misallocation of scarce natural gas resources, creating a potential gap between supply and demand.

The energy sector reforms were stalled, and Pakistan has since been faced with serious energy shortages that have crippled production and exports since 2009.

Sharif government had won the elections on the promise of energy reforms but the progress so far has not been that impressive. The telecommunications sector witnessed a boom since the private sector companies were allowed licenses to operate cellular phones.

Telecommunications Corporation was broken and new licenses, including those for wireless local loop, were issued. The customers are reaping rich dividends as the prices of phone calls, whether local, long distance, or international, are currently only a fraction of the previous rates. Lower telecommunications costs and increased penetration have a favourable impact on the economy's productivity.

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

Since the 3G and 4G licenses were issued a few years ago, economic governance has been a cornerstone of the governance agenda in the 2000s. The devolution plan transferred powers and responsibilities from the federal and provincial governments to local levels, including those related to social services.

Decentralization, de-concentration, accountability, and people's participation in their local affairs could have improved the delivery of basic services to citizens at the grassroots level. However, the transition created its own set of dislocations and disruptions, particularly in the exercise of responsibilities towards law and order and security.

rity that shifted the authority from deputy commissioners to elected District Nazims. This problem could have been fixed but

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

Designed in 2001, a significant vacuum has been created in the delivery of basic services at the grassroots level.

Separating policy and regulatory functions, which were earlier combined within a ministry, was another key move. Regulatory agencies for economic activities such as banking, finance, aviation, telecommunications, power, oil, and gas are now independent of the ministry.

quasi-judicial powers are held by the chairman and board members of regulatory authorities. These authorities are protected by security of tenure and cannot be removed arbitrarily. They are also not accountable to any executive authority and conduct public hearings and consultations with stakeholders.

However, these regulatory authorities have not been fully effective due to the lack of proper placement of individuals in their positions.

As the main anti-corruption agency, a significant number of high government officials, politicians, and businessmen were sentenced to prison, fined heavily, and disqualified from holding public office following conviction in the courts. Major loan and tax defaulters were also investigated, prosecuted, and forced to repay their overdue debts.

Fiscal indiscipline had to be surgically removed to prevent its recurrence in the future. To achieve this, a fiscal responsibility law was approved by the parliament. This law ensures that the government's debt-GDP ratio is reduced by 2.5 percentage points each year and does not exceed 60 per cent. Any deviation from this target requires an explanation.

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

Parliament and the government need approval for laws. However, this law has been breached for the last few years because it does not have any corrective measures.

The restructuring and strengthening of the Central Bank and the banking sector played a crucial role in the economic revival. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) formulated its monetary policy, macroprudential regulations, and development programs while keeping price stability, financial stability, and growth in mind.

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

initiatives which involved a fine balancing act and at times difficult trade-offs. As inflationary pressures had not surfaced in the early 2000s and fiscal policy lever could not be exercised due to a heavy debt burden, the Central Bank used monetary policy to provide the stimulus to kick start the economy.

Pakistan's economy was fully utilized, and new investment was undertaken to expand productive capacity during this period. The period of expansionary monetary policy gave a significant boost to output expansion and employment.

To government enterprises were removed and interest rates and exchange rates were allowed to be determined by the market interplay. Credit allocation decisions were made by the individual bank guided by prudential regulations without any directive from the Central Bank.

The banking system started to meet the financing requirements of sectors such as agriculture, small- and medium-sized enterprises, salaried classes, and the poor who had no access to credit in the past. The borrower base of the banking system multiplied from over one million to 4.5 million households in five years.

Small and medium entrepreneurs are using bank credit to expand their fabrication and manufacturing capacities and upgrading technology. Landless labor and poor women in the rural areas are receiving microloans for poultry, small livestock, sewing machines, etc. The number of households who have borrowed microfinance loans has gone up from almost zero to about three million.

Despite these developments in the early 2000s, the recent experience of banking lending is not very satisfactory. The temptation to channel funds to the government for financing fiscal deficit has diverted credit from the productive sectors, particularly agriculture and SMEs. The outreach for SMEs, agriculture, and microfinance remains limited and is not expanding at a desirable pace, particularly in rural areas and backward districts.

Therefore, become a key area of concern. A large number of observers and casual empiricists both within and outside Pakistan have been making bold but untested assertions that it is the massive aid flows and debt relief resulting from Pakistan's participation in the war against terror after 11 September 2001 that has been responsible for the country's economic situation.

Please send me the next portion of the text.

Following the event, workers' remittances shifted from the open market to the interbank market, and debt relief was provided. New loans and grants were granted, and official sanctions were removed. The Coalition Support Fund of US$1 billion annually started pouring in from the USA, and the US military and civilian foreign aid was restored.

Thousands of innocent lives of Pakistani soldiers and civilians have been lost, a deep sense of insecurity prevails in the country. Foreign travel advisories have discouraged visits of businessmen, tourists, and buyers, higher war risk premiums are charged, shipping freights have gone up, insurance premiums on Pakistani goods have escalated, and export orders have been diverted. The frequency and ferocity with which suicide bombers have attacked political targets has also contributed to this sense of insecurity.

Pakistan's economy is facing significant challenges due to the law and order problem in the country. Cancellations of export orders worth billions of dollars have occurred as buyers are unable to visit Pakistan and new markets cannot be accessed for the same reason.

In contrast to other regional countries, Pakistan's exports have slowed down, particularly in the textiles sector, due to the uncertainty created in the minds of foreign buyers and their limited access to the country.

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

The information technology (IT) industry has been a significant contributor to the country's economic growth, making it an important sector to focus on.

Pakistan's economy has been severely impacted since 2001, when all outsourcing contracts were cancelled. The country is no longer a priority for the global IT industry, which is rapidly expanding.

A thorough calculation of the costs and benefits of Pakistan's participation in the war against terror would reveal that the benefits received through foreign assistance are insignificant compared to the costs incurred since 2001.

include the huge social and psychic costs borne by the entire population, particularly the internal displacement and involuntary migration of millions of inhabitants of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Those who attribute the economic turnaround to foreign assistance should look at both the costs and benefits of the calculation.

The data shows that even if we assume the extreme case that all official development assistance is eliminated, the economic consequences would be severe.

Pakistan's economy received a significant "gift" from 9/11 in the form of transfers, debt relief, and foreign loans/credits. At its peak, this combined amount represented only 10% of the country's total foreign exchange earnings in FY 2006.

Pakistan's own foreign exchange earning capacity expanded significantly during this period, growing from $15 billion annually to $46 billion, or from 20% to 33% of GDP. This growth was largely driven by Pakistani exporters and workers overseas, who provided the bulk of foreign exchange support.

Pakistan's economy has seen significant growth, but it is also heavily reliant on foreign loans and grants. While the 9/11 attacks did lead to increased foreign investment, this is not the only factor contributing to the country's economic growth. In fact, Pakistan has been receiving foreign loans and grants since the 1950s. In the two years preceding 9/11, foreign exchange earnings from loans and grants made up 16% and 19.9% of the country's overall foreign exchange earnings, respectively.

Pakistan's economy was in a relatively stable position in FY 2000-2001, even before the 9/11 attacks. In FY 1999-2000, the overall balance deficit was less than 1% of GDP.

good that has happened to Pakistan is a direct consequence of 9/11 is not only incorrect but highly exaggerated. The reasons for build-up of foreign exchange reserves were not only the debt relief and external capital flows but also macroeconomic policies. The Central Bank pursued a stable exchange rate at a realistic level for several years that helped maintain predictability and competitiveness of Pakistani exports. There are several factors that contributed to the build-up of foreign exchange reserves.

Pakistan's economy underwent a significant liberalization of its foreign exchange regime. Foreign investors were allowed to bring in capital without restrictions and repatriate their capital, profits, dividends, and fees without prior approvals. Foreign companies could also raise funds from domestic banks and capital markets.

Financial sector reforms accelerated during this period, with the Central Bank being at the forefront of these changes.

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

was granted autonomy and the control of the Ministry of Finance over banking institutions was diluted.

Net non-performing loans of the banking system were brought down to less than 3 per cent of total advances and loans; minimum capital requirements were also strengthened.

Pakistan's economy has made significant improvements in recent years. The requirements for loans were raised to US$1 billion, and the quality of new loans improved. Capital adequacy ratios were increased and made variable based on the strength of the bank.

Pakistan’s economy is transitioning into an efficient, privately owned and managed sector, but regulated by a strong and vigilant Central Bank. The private sector now owns 80% of the banking assets, and the sector is thriving in a competitive environment.

Efficiency of services in response to market competition is an area of concern. The widening of banking spreads remains a problem, indicating inefficiencies in the system.

The question arises: If structural reforms were implemented, why has economic growth faltered and stagnated since 2008? Five explanations can be advanced.

First, there was high political uncertainty caused due to the conflict between President Musharraf and the Judiciary in 2007 leading to widespread agitations throughout the country. The situation was exacerbated by the declaration of emergency and the issuance of the National Reconciliation Ordinance that gave reprieve to all outstanding criminal cases against politicians. The assassination of the most popular leader of the country, Benazir Bhutto, and the elections of the year added to the turmoil.

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

2008 further added to political instability. The caretaker government failed to take timely and appropriate decisions in 2007 to respond to the global price hike, including those for food products, oil, electricity, and gas. These price adjustments were avoided due to impending elections, but caused serious damage to the economic balances.

Here is the processed text:

In the Fiscal Responsibility Act, excessive government borrowing to meet the deficit, combined with increased prices of imported commodities outside the administered prices regime of the government, led to higher inflation. Third, electricity and gas load shedding due to a shortfall in generation and poor distribution had an adverse impact on manufacturing and export sectors. This resulted in large-scale manufacturing growth slowing down to 4.8 per cent, almost half of the rate recorded previously.

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

In 2007-2008, the performance of the sector has been unimpressive. A worsening trade imbalance has led to an external current account deficit exceeding 8.4 percent of GDP.

Foreign capital inflows required to finance this deficit dried up due to political uncertainty, leading to a depletion of foreign reserves.

Pakistan's economy faced turbulent waters in 2008. The country's exchange reserves were depleted, leading to a panic in the foreign exchange market and a depreciation of the rupee by about 25 percent vis-à-vis the US dollar. This further intensified inflationary pressures.

The country needed strong leadership to steer the economy out of this crisis. However, Pakistan had five finance ministers and five governors of the Central Bank during this period, which only added to the instability.

Here is the processed text:

The 2014 period saw economic management take a backseat to political management and coalition politics. The incoming government neglected the economy, reversing or failing to pursue tax reforms. This led to low investment and stagnant growth rates.

Note: I removed the metadata and LaTeX math, and condensed the text to focus on the main points. I also removed unnecessary words and phrases to make the text more concise and easier to read.

Effective rate of protection went up. In income tax, the universal self-assessment was not fully implemented as the random audit of selected tax returns was deeply resisted by powerful lobbies.

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges remained stuck at a dismally low level of 10 per cent. New concessions and exemptions were granted to a select few through the SROs.

The privatization process of public sector enterprises was halted, and those laid off from service in 1997 and 1998 were rehired with full benefits for the past 15 years, causing further financial stress.

Pakistan's economy faced significant challenges in the past. Chief executives were appointed based on loyalty and affiliation rather than competence and suitability for the job. As a result, many of these appointees were involved in corruption and abuse of power, leading to losses of public enterprises amounting to $5 billion annually, which was one-fifth of the recurrent budget.

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

Recurrent budget. Civil services and the institutions forming the main pillars of the delivery of basic services to the citizens, including law and order and security infrastructure, education and health, drinking water and sanitation, adjudication of disputes and land records, have become totally dysfunctional.

A comprehensive report on the reform of administration and civil services was prepared through a broad consultative process, but the findings of the report have remained shelved so far.

Devolution of powers from the federal to the provincial government and the large financial resources transferred to the provinces under the 18th amendment and the 7th National Finance Commission award are most welcome. But this devolution remains incomplete unless the powers and resources are further decentralized and devolved to the local governments. Since 2009, this tier at which most of the interaction between the citizens and the government functions has been the focus of many reforms.

Pakistan's economy and regional challenges have worsened governance at the grassroots level. The hardships and difficulties faced by teachers, health workers, and low-ranking police and other officials have remained non-existent.

Challenges for the Future

Structural reforms in finance, tariff and tax administration, privatization of state-owned enterprises, and creation of an enabling environment for the private sector have led to a 2-percentage point increase in total factor productivity.

Pakistan's economy should have risen from 5 to 7 per cent annual growth if the economic potential was valid. The actual outcomes would fluctuate depending on factors such as agriculture production, external economic environment, and macroeconomic stability. It is reasonable to expect growth rates to range between 6 and 8 per cent.

annually in the next decade if Pakistan gets back to its growth trajectory sooner than later and all other things remained constant. Let us analyze the pre-conditions for future growth in Pakistan.

First, how far will global economic conditions remain favourable for Pakistan? The global economy remains buoyant at present despite recent financial turbulence in the US mortgage market and has never had such sustained

Here is the processed text:

High growth is driven by the USA, but emerging countries like China and India are increasing their relative share. The decoupling of these economies from the USA has not been fully tested and proven, and therefore the risks to the global economy cannot be ignored. Most analysts believe in a soft landing and a continuation of a benign environment, which would allow emerging countries to benefit.

Pakistan's successful integration into the global markets will determine the extent of benefits to the external sector. Since 2012, exports have been stagnating, showing a declining share in the buoyant world market. Diversification of exports in composition as well as markets is necessary to capture the lost market share.

and research and development should replace the traditional mode of private firms looking to the government for concessions and subsidies. This business-as-usual mode would be highly detrimental to inculcating private sector dynamism and innovation.

Policymakers in Pakistan should steadfastly persevere in pursuing sound, credible and consistent economic policies.

Protecting decision making should give way to a more collegial and collaborative process. Fiscal Responsibility Law would certainly act as a safeguard against excessive borrowing, but there are many other policy lapses or delayed responses which can do harm.

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

Strengthening local government institutions would help to improve governance and the overall economic stability of the country.

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

The reluctance of provincial governments to part with powers, lack of supporting infrastructure, and absence of capacity building at lower levels are continuing constraints that need to be tackled.

Pakistan's key institutions have lost their way and need to be brought back to their original track. Accountability for results must be built into the system, rather than enforced extraneously. The country's economy requires the supply of critical infrastructural facilities, including power, natural gas, pipelines, roads, railways, urban mass transit, and water supply.

Pakistan's economy and regional challenges are expected to keep pace with growing demands of the industry, commerce, and general public. Despite increased development expenditure, the government would not be able to meet this demand in any meaningful way. Public-private partnerships in capital investment, operations, and maintenance would have to be put in place.

Skills, technology, and innovation are changing the competitive advantages of the country.

Pakistan would have to redouble its efforts in the fields of education, skill upgradation and S&T. Raising the average years of schooling received by Pakistan's population of 15 years and older, to the levels of countries such as Thailand or Venezuela, would result in real per-capita growth rate by 2 percentage points per year.

Investing in human capital through better education and healthcare also directly benefits the poor by improving their economic prospects.

Pakistan's economy faces significant challenges, including their current living conditions. Although a beginning has been made in higher education, the state of scientific research organizations in Pakistan is dismal. They need to revamp their governance and incentive structure to match China and India.

The continuation of political stability and a predictable, orderly, and constitutional transition of power would be a major boost to the economy.

Here is the processed text:

Pakistan's economic prospects would benefit from a political transition process that is fair and transparent. Different political parties taking over the reins of government at regular intervals would mitigate risks associated with uncertainty. While there is no guarantee that economic policies would remain on track, the thrust of all leading parties' economic policies is similar, which is a positive aspect often lost in political bickering.

Pakistan's rivalries and unwarranted accusations against each other must be addressed. The links between political stability, economic growth, and social cohesion are mutually reinforcing and need to be further developed. The gains achieved so far can be reversed if Pakistan does not manage political governance with tolerance, a healthy respect for dissent and differences of opinion, and reliance on institutions rather than personalities.

Pakistan is facing serious problems of internal and external security. A return to normalcy in the security conditions of the country would reassure the investor community and help in the mobility of factors of production. Foreign buyers and technical personnel would resume their visits to Pakistan as improved security would allow their free movement in and out of the country.

Raising investment in physical capital, particularly in water and power management, education, and healthcare, as well as improvements in institutional quality, will have the largest payoff in terms of increased growth and reduced poverty.

Pakistan's economy needs to improve its institutional quality to raise the pace of economic growth. This can be achieved by increasing the investment rate and improving health and education indicators to levels seen in countries like Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore. To do this, Pakistan needs to raise its tax revenue yield to create fiscal space for social programs.

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges
Pakistan is strategically located as a bridge between South Asia and Central Asia, China and South Asia and West Asia. 

Pakistan needs to focus on improving its infrastructure spending, while reducing its debt to GDP ratio. This could be achieved by broadening the tax base and better taxing agriculture, urban property, and service income, which could yield an increase of more than 2 to 3 percent of GDP in revenues.

Pakistan's economy and regional challenges are intertwined. The country has high intra-regional trade, with as much as one-fifth of its trade occurring within the region. However, this regional integration is lagging, with only six percent of intra-regional trade in recent years.

The region. Common historical and cultural heritage would have eased the movement of people, educational exchanges, access to each other's media and cultural resources, and sharing of scientific and technological knowledge across the region. However, none of this has happened in South Asia.

Trade facilitation across borders within the region is hampered by various hurdles. Issues of phytosanitary, health, and environmental standards, as well as quality standards, are major obstacles.

Pakistan's Economy and Regional Challenges

Truck crossings, where allowed, take several days and allegations of harassment by border officials are rampant. Non-tariff barriers on India-Pakistan trade have diverted normal trade flows to informal networks or border trade, or are routed through third parties such as Dubai and Singapore, raising costs for end-users.

Demography: Negative and Positive
Looking to the future, particularly the long term, South Asia's challenges are many but at least four of them will make a material difference to the social and economic outcomes in the next 50 years. The first challenge is the demographic: South Asia will be the only region with more than 50% of its population in the productive employable age bracket. The flip side is that this will also lead to a significant decline in the proportion of the population above 65 years, which could put a strain on the pension and healthcare systems.

This demographic change will require a rethinking of the social and economic policies in the region, including the provision of education and healthcare, as well as the development of a robust pension system.

The region can ease its unemployment problems by supplying young workers to the rest of the world, particularly in an environment of ageing populations and rising dependence ratios.

To the extent that these countries invest in education, particularly technical and vocational education, expand access to higher and professional education and upgrade the quality and relevance of instruction, there is a strong likelihood of this demographic transition paying dividends.

The country is facing two major challenges: education and climate change. Firstly, the education system needs to be improved, equipping students with marketable skills and enabling them to move across borders. Two-thirds of the world's illiterate population resides in South Asia, with new entrants to the labor force every year equivalent to the population of a mid-size country.

Agriculture, food production, and energy supplies are critical issues in South Asia, where over 500 million people have no access to electricity. Growth is often associated with carbon emissions, making it a serious dilemma for policymakers to balance energy needs and growth while addressing global warming.

The study suggests that the imperative of climate change and policies to reduce carbon emissions may hinder progress towards various development goals, including poverty eradication, disease prevention, and environmental sustainability. South Asia, in particular, is vulnerable to climate change due to its geography, poverty levels, and population density.

demands on an already stressed and largely degraded natural resource base. With an estimated 600 million people subsisting on less than US$1.25 per person a day, even small climate variations can cause irreversible losses and tip a large number of people into destitution. The region shares common geological formations and river basins, leading natural hazards to frequently transcend national boundaries.

the frequency and incidence of such natural disasters is projected to increase. If climate projections are indicative of future trends, the risks associated with water-related climate variability are likely to worsen. The Himalayas is a vital life-sustaining resource for South Asia, supporting approximately 1.5 billion people who live directly in the floodplains of its many rivers, including the Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna.

With melting glaciers, flood risks would increase in the near future. The floods in Pakistan in August 2010 caused major devastation to human lives and property, a preview of the damage that extreme climatic events can bring about. In the long term, water shortages could result at an unparalleled scale.

Agricultural incomes are part of the worst-case climate scenarios for the region, as well as a growing scarcity of water. Avoiding this future will necessitate balancing more variable water supplies with the accelerating demand for water and would require significant adjustment to the region's agriculture.

Asia is able to reap the benefits of technology and use it as an engine of growth and human development. The capacity of South Asian countries to assimilate, adapt, and widely diffuse emerging technologies is constrained by shortages of skilled, technical, and vocational manpower, outdated educational systems, and neglect of R&D.

A highly competitive world has raised the demand for skilled workers and professionals, yet the record of many South Asian countries in terms of producing these workers is often lacking.

Meeting the demand for technical and vocational education and training (TVET) in South Asia is not encouraging. The major obstacle to successful technological diffusion is the deficit in skills. The global average for TVET enrollment is 10 percent, but in South Asia, this rate is only 1 percent.

the gender gap in South Asia is quite significant. The region has one of the lowest gross tertiary enrolment rates in the world, at 10.5 per cent, second only to sub-Saharan Africa. The disparities in access to higher education by females are also a major concern.

Pakistan's economy faces challenges in expansion of quality higher education in the region. Limited availability of well-qualified and competent teachers is a serious constraint. The curriculum is outdated and has poor linkages with industry, making it difficult for graduates to find decent productive jobs.

Pakistan's economy will benefit from its transportation network linked with Central Asian Republics and Western China, resulting in additional economic gains of 0.5 to 1 percentage point of the GDP in the coming decade. The completion of the Chinese Pakistan Economic Corridor will facilitate this growth. Once the sanctions are removed, work on the Iran–Pakistan gas pipeline should be accelerated.

Central Asia–South Asia electricity grid would link Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. The Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan Pipeline will

Pakistan's future economic prospects look promising but depend on several critical factors.

The energy shortages in Pakistan can be relieved by importing power from other countries. For instance, power import from India to Punjab can ease the pressure in the Lahore area.

macroeconomic policies, a strong institutional and governance framework, investment in infrastructure and human development, and political stability are essential for Pakistan's economic growth. Under these favorable conditions, it should be possible to add 2 to 2.5 percentage points to the current trend growth rate, which would result in per-capita income doubling to US$2,600 by 2030.

The World Bank published a report in 2015 titled "Shock waves: Managing the impacts of climate change on poverty".
